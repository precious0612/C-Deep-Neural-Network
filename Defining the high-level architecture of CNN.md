Defining the high-level architecture of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) API in C involves outlining the main components and their interactions. Here's a rough outline of how you might approach it:

1. **Main Structures**:
   - Define structures for representing different layers (e.g., convolutional layer, pooling layer, fully connected layer).
   - Each structure should contain relevant parameters and data needed for computation (e.g., filter weights, biases, activation functions).
   - Consider using typedef to create aliases for these structures for easier readability.

2. **Model Structure**:
   - Define a structure to represent the overall CNN model.
   - This structure should contain a sequence or graph of layers and possibly other parameters like input shape and output shape.
   - Consider using arrays, linked lists, or other data structures to manage the sequence or graph of layers.

3. **Forward Pass Function**:
   - Define a function to perform the forward pass through the CNN model.
   - This function should take input data and the CNN model structure as input and produce output predictions.
   - Implement the logic for propagating input data through each layer, applying operations like convolution, pooling, and activation functions.

4. **Backward Pass Function**:
   - Define a function to perform the backward pass through the CNN model for training purposes (e.g., backpropagation).
   - This function should compute gradients with respect to model parameters, allowing for optimization (e.g., gradient descent).
   - Implement the logic for computing gradients for each layer and updating parameters accordingly.

5. **Loss Function Implementation**:
   - Define functions for various loss functions (e.g., cross-entropy, mean squared error).
   - These functions should take predicted outputs and ground truth labels as input and produce a scalar value representing the loss.
   - Implement the logic for computing the loss based on the predicted outputs and ground truth labels.

6. **Optimizer Implementation**:
   - Define functions for different optimization algorithms (e.g., stochastic gradient descent, Adam).
   - These functions should update model parameters based on computed gradients and optimization parameters.
   - Implement the logic for updating model parameters using the chosen optimization algorithm.

7. **Training Functionality**:
   - Define functions to facilitate training of the CNN model.
   - These functions should handle the training loop, including forward and backward passes, loss computation, and parameter updates.
   - Implement logic for iterating over training data, performing forward and backward passes, and updating model parameters.

8. **Testing and Evaluation Functions**:
   - Define functions to evaluate the performance of the trained model on validation or test data.
   - These functions should compute relevant evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall) based on model predictions and ground truth labels.
   - Implement logic for computing evaluation metrics and providing feedback on model performance.

9. **Memory Management**:
   - Consider memory management aspects, such as dynamically allocating memory for model parameters and releasing memory when it's no longer needed.
   - Implement logic for initializing model parameters, allocating memory for intermediate computations, and deallocating memory when done.

10. **Error Handling**:
    - Implement error handling mechanisms to handle potential errors or edge cases gracefully.
    - Define error codes or error messages to provide meaningful feedback to users in case of errors.

11. **Documentation and Usage Examples**:
    - Provide comprehensive documentation for the API, including descriptions of functions, structures, parameters, and usage examples.
    - Document expected input and output formats, function signatures, and any relevant constraints or assumptions.

12. **Testing and Validation**:
    - Test the API thoroughly to ensure correctness and robustness.
    - Validate the API design by building example CNN models and verifying that they produce expected results.

By following this outline, you can design a high-level architecture for a CNN API in C that provides the necessary functionality for building, training, and evaluating convolutional neural networks.
