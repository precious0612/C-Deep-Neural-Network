To complete the second part, "Input Data Representation," you'll need to define data structures and functions for handling input data such as images. Here's a detailed breakdown of how you can approach this:

1. **Image Data Structure**:
   - Define a structure to represent image data. This structure should include:
     - Dimensions: Width, height, and number of channels (e.g., RGB channels).
     - Data storage: Use a suitable data structure to store pixel values (e.g., 1D array, 2D array, or tensor).
     - Data type: Specify the data type for pixel values (e.g., uint8, float32).

2. **Data Preprocessing Functions** (Optional):
   - Define functions to preprocess input images before feeding them into the CNN model. Preprocessing steps may include:
     - Normalization: Scaling pixel values to a specific range (e.g., [0, 1] or [-1, 1]).
     - Resizing: Adjusting image dimensions to match the input shape expected by the CNN model.
     - Augmentation: Applying random transformations to increase the diversity of training data (optional).

3. **Data Loading Functions**:
   - Define functions to load image data from external sources (e.g., files, databases) into the defined data structure.
     - Consider supporting various image formats (e.g., JPEG, PNG) and handling different data sources efficiently.

4. **Batching and Mini-batching**:
   - Implement functions to organize input data into batches or mini-batches for efficient processing during training and inference.
     - Consider batching strategies to balance between memory usage and computational efficiency.

5. **Integration with Model Input**:
   - Ensure compatibility between the input data representation and the input layer of the CNN model.
     - Convert input data into the appropriate format expected by the model (e.g., array).

6. **Error Handling**:
   - Implement error handling mechanisms to deal with potential issues during data loading and preprocessing.
     - Handle cases such as missing data, invalid file formats, or insufficient memory gracefully.

7. **Documentation and Usage Examples**:
   - Document the input data representation API, including function signatures, parameters, and usage examples.
     - Provide guidelines on how to prepare and load input data for training and evaluation.

8. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Test the input data representation functions thoroughly to ensure correctness and robustness.
     - Validate data loading, preprocessing, and integration with the CNN model using sample datasets.

By completing these steps, you'll have a comprehensive input data representation module that seamlessly integrates with your CNN API, allowing users to efficiently prepare and load image data for training and inference.
