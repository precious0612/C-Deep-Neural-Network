Sure, here's a detailed guide on how to design the third part of your CNN API in C:

1. **Convolutional Layers**:
   - Define a structure for representing a convolutional layer, which includes:
     - Parameters such as filter size (width and height), number of filters, padding, and stride.
     - Filter weights: A 4D array representing the weights of each filter.
     - Biases: An array representing the bias term for each filter.
     - Activation function: A function pointer or an enum indicating the activation function applied after convolution.
   - Consider using typedef to create an alias for this structure, such as `ConvLayer`.

2. **Pooling Layers**:
   - Define a structure for representing pooling layers, including:
     - Parameters such as pool size (width and height) and stride.
     - Pooling type: An enum indicating the type of pooling (e.g., max pooling, average pooling).
   - Consider using typedef to create an alias for this structure, such as `PoolLayer`.

3. **Fully Connected Layers**:
   - Define a structure for fully connected layers, which includes:
     - Parameters such as the number of neurons in the layer and the activation function.
     - Weights: A 2D array representing the weights connecting the previous layer to this layer.
     - Biases: An array representing the bias term for each neuron.
   - Use typedef to create an alias for this structure, such as `FCLayer`.

4. **Activation Functions**:
   - Define enums or function pointers for various activation functions like ReLU, sigmoid, and tanh.
   - Consider creating a separate header file for activation functions and including it in your main CNN API header.

5. **Dropout Layers**:
   - If your CNN architecture includes dropout layers, define a structure for dropout layers that includes parameters such as the dropout rate.
   - This structure may not require weights or biases, as dropout layers typically do not have trainable parameters.

Once you have defined the necessary structures for each layer type, you can integrate them into your overall CNN model structure. Your CNN model structure should maintain a sequence or graph of layers, similar to what you've done previously.

Remember to provide functions for initializing these layer structures, setting their parameters, and performing forward and backward passes through each layer type. Additionally, ensure that memory management and error handling are implemented appropriately for each layer type.
