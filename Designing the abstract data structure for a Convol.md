Designing the abstract data structure for a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) API involves several key steps. Here's a high-level outline of the process:

1. **Define High-Level Architecture**: Decide on the overall structure of the CNN API. This includes determining what components the API will have and how they will interact.

2. **Input Data Representation**: Define the data structures that will represent input data (e.g., images) and labels. Considerations include image dimensions, color channels, and data preprocessing.

3. **Layer Abstractions**:
    - **Convolutional Layers**: Define data structures for representing convolutional layers. This may include parameters such as filter size, number of filters, and activation functions.
    - **Pooling Layers**: Define data structures for pooling layers (e.g., max pooling, average pooling). Consider parameters such as pool size and stride.
    - **Fully Connected Layers**: Define data structures for fully connected layers. Include parameters such as the number of neurons and activation functions.
    - **Activation Functions**: Define data structures for various activation functions (e.g., ReLU, sigmoid, tanh).
    - **Dropout Layers**: Define data structures for dropout layers, if applicable.

4. **Model Architecture**:
    - Define a data structure to represent the overall architecture of the CNN model. This could involve a sequential model or a more complex graph-based structure.
    - Consider how layers are connected and how data flows through the network.

5. **Loss Functions**: Define data structures for different loss functions (e.g., categorical cross-entropy, mean squared error) that can be used during training.

6. **Optimizer Configuration**: Define data structures for optimizers (e.g., SGD, Adam, RMSprop) along with their parameters (learning rate, momentum, etc.).

7. **Training Configuration**:
    - Define data structures for training configurations such as batch size, number of epochs, and early stopping criteria.
    - Consider incorporating callbacks for monitoring training progress and adjusting hyperparameters dynamically.

8. **Evaluation Metrics**: Define data structures for evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) to assess the performance of the model.

9. **API Interface**:
    - Define the methods and functions that will be exposed by the API for building, training, and evaluating CNN models.
    - Ensure the API is user-friendly and intuitive, with clear documentation and error handling.

10. **Testing and Validation**:
    - Test the API thoroughly to ensure correctness and robustness.
    - Validate the API design by building example CNN models and verifying that they produce expected results.

11. **Performance Optimization**:
    - Consider optimizations to improve the efficiency and speed of the CNN API, such as parallelization and hardware acceleration.

12. **Documentation**:
    - Write comprehensive documentation for the API, including usage examples, tutorials, and API reference.

13. **Versioning and Maintenance**:
    - Plan for versioning and maintenance of the API to accommodate future updates and changes in requirements.

By following these steps, you can design a well-structured and effective API for building and training Convolutional Neural Networks.
